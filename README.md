# Genome scans reveal shared islands of differentiation and balancing selection on chemosensory genes in a rapid sea snake radiation (Hydrophis)

Data files and analysis scripts. Result directories are structured with `README`
files, which are built from the corresponding `.Rmd` files. These files contain
the analysis code, and code used to generate figures.

The `script` directory contains BASH scripts used to process the raw data.

## Result sections

1. [Alignment/variant calling results][results1]
2. [Demography][results2]
3. [Divergence statistics][results3]
